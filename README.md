# Manaz PR Portfolio

[Manaz PR - Frontend Developer from India](https://manaz.vercel.app/)

This is my portfolio website, proudly built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). The content is managed through [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) and accessed via GraphQL endpoints using [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/).

- Fork or Clone the project
- Run `yarn install`
- Example .env file:
